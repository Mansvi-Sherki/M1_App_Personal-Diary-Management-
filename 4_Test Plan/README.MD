# TEST PLAN 


A Test Plan refers to a detailed document that catalogs the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimations, deadlines, and the resources required for completing that particular project.


Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the application under test.

The purpose of a test plan is to set expectations and align the team for success throughout the entire testing process.
